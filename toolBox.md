# Tool Box to Use when I will do my Developement and Coding

## Coding
1. Arrays.sort() - If I want to sort anything I will use this.
2. n(n+1)/2 - always use this formula to calculate sum of n natural numbers.
## Developement
1. To maintain syncronization in github repository and local repository use this command to pull the latest content from github repo to local:
```
git pull origin
```
