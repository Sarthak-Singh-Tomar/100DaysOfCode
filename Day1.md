## Wrapper Class
1. Wrapper Class: A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types. In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.
2. AutoBoxing: Automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.
3. UnBoxing:  It is just the reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing.
